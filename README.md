##   <img src="images/prize.png" alt="Alt Text" width="4.5%" > Introduction 

Clustering is a fundamental technique in machine learning and data analysis, used to group similar data points together. This repository provides implementations and examples of two well-known clustering algorithms: K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

If you find this repository useful, consider giving it a :octocat:  :star: star  :star: :octocat: and following my GitHub account :eyes:. Your support motivates me to continue creating and sharing more open-source projects!

### <img src="images/location.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="3.5%" >  K-Means Clustering 

K-Means is an iterative algorithm that aims to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It works by assigning each data point to the nearest cluster center and then recalculating the cluster centers based on the assigned points. This process continues until convergence.

### <img src="images/location.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="3.5%" > Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering is a technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or dividing larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive). It creates a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which can be used to visualize the clustering process.

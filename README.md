## Introduction

Clustering is a fundamental technique in machine learning and data analysis, used to group similar data points together. This repository provides implementations and examples of two well-known clustering algorithms: K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

## Algorithms

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an iterative algorithm that aims to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It works by assigning each data point to the nearest cluster center and then recalculating the cluster centers based on the assigned points. This process continues until convergence.

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering is a technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or dividing larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive). It creates a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which can be used to visualize the clustering process.

## Usage

To use the clustering algorithms provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clustering-algorithms.git
